Hallo. I am Leo van Geest from the Netherlands.

As a retired IT profesional i like tinkering with new technologies as they emerge,
or reiterate over some existing technologies.

Right now a am looking at ways to connect raspberry pi pico-w boards to next-js.

I got an experiment running wich utilizes the MQTT protocol.
